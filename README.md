# Path-Visualizer

The Path-Visualizer tool is a Python application developed with Pygame that showcases Dijkstra's algorithm in action. It allows users to interactively create grids, set start and end points, and designate obstacles. Upon initiation, Dijkstra's algorithm calculates and displays the shortest path, providing an intuitive visualization of pathfinding in action.


# How it works

## Getting Started

- The top left box always serves as the starting point.
- Select the destination box by left-clicking on it. Only one box can be designated as the destination.

## Adding Obstacles

- Define obstacles by right-clicking on any number of boxes on the grid. These obstacles are impassable and will be considered during the pathfinding process.

## Starting the Algorithm

- Begin the algorithm by pressing the spacebar. The application will then calculate the shortest path, if one exists.
 
## Visualization

- The tool will visually display the process of the algorithm in action, highlighting the path from the starting point to the destination.

## Path Result

- If a path is found, it will be displayed as the shortest route. If no path is found due to impassable obstacles, the tool will indicate this.
